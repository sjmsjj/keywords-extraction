in set-system auctions, there are several overlapping teams of agents,
and a task that can be completed by any of these teams. the 
auctioneer"s goal is to hire a team and pay as little as possible. 
examples of this setting include shortest-path auctions and vertex-cover
auctions. recently, karlin, kempe and tamir introduced a new 
definition of frugality ratio for this problem. informally, the frugality
ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to a desired
payment bound. the ratio captures the extent to which the 
mechanism overpays, relative to perceived fair cost in a truthful auction.
in this paper, we propose a new truthful polynomial-time auction
for the vertex cover problem and bound its frugality ratio. we show
that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and
the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible
worst-case bound; this is the first auction for this problem to have
these properties. moreover, we show how to transform any 
truthful auction into a frugal one while preserving the approximation
ratio. also, we consider two natural modifications of the definition
of karlin et al., and we analyse the properties of the resulting 
payment bounds, such as monotonicity, computational hardness, and
robustness with respect to the draw-resolution rule. we study the
relationships between the different payment bounds, both for 
general set systems and for specific set-system auctions, such as path
auctions and vertex-cover auctions. we use these new definitions
in the proof of our main result for vertex-cover auctions via a 
bootstrapping technique, which may be of independent interest.
