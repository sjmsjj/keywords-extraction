we present an approximately-efficient and 
approximatelystrategyproof auction mechanism for a single-good multi-unit
allocation problem. the bidding language in our auctions 
allows marginal-decreasing piecewise constant curves. first, we
develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the
multi-unit allocation problem, which computes a (1 + 
)approximation in worst-case time t = o(n3
/ ), given n bids
each with a constant number of pieces. second, we embed this
approximation scheme within a vickrey-clarke-groves (vcg)
mechanism and compute payments to n agents for an 
asymptotic cost of o(t log n). the maximal possible gain from 
manipulation to a bidder in the combined scheme is bounded by
/(1+ )v , where v is the total surplus in the efficient outcome.
