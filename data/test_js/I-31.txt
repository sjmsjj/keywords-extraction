agents that must reach agreements with other agents need to 
reason about how their preferences, judgments, and beliefs might be
aggregated with those of others by the social choice mechanisms
that govern their interactions. the recently emerging field of 
judgment aggregation studies aggregation from a logical perspective,
and considers how multiple sets of logical formulae can be 
aggregated to a single consistent set. as a special case, judgment
aggregation can be seen to subsume classical preference 
aggregation. we present a modal logic that is intended to support reasoning
about judgment aggregation scenarios (and hence, as a special case,
about preference aggregation): the logical language is interpreted
directly in judgment aggregation rules. we present a sound and
complete axiomatisation of such rules. we show that the logic can
express aggregation rules such as majority voting; rule properties
such as independence; and results such as the discursive paradox,
arrow"s theorem and condorcet"s paradox - which are derivable
as formal theorems of the logic. the logic is parameterised in such
a way that it can be used as a general framework for comparing
the logical properties of different types of aggregation - including
classical preference aggregation.
