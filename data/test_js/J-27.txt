a sequence of prices and demands are rationalizable if there
exists a concave, continuous and monotone utility function
such that the demands are the maximizers of the utility
function over the budget set corresponding to the price.
afriat [1] presented necessary and sufficient conditions for
a finite sequence to be rationalizable. varian [20] and later
blundell et al. [3, 4] continued this line of work studying
nonparametric methods to forecasts demand. their results
essentially characterize learnability of degenerate classes of
demand functions and therefore fall short of giving a 
general degree of confidence in the forecast. the present paper
complements this line of research by introducing a statistical
model and a measure of complexity through which we are
able to study the learnability of classes of demand functions
and derive a degree of confidence in the forecasts.
our results show that the class of all demand functions
has unbounded complexity and therefore is not learnable,
but that there exist interesting and potentially useful classes
that are learnable from finite samples. we also present a
learning algorithm that is an adaptation of a new proof of
afriat"s theorem due to teo and vohra [17].
