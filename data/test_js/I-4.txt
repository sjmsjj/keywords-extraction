a negotiation chain is formed when multiple related negotiations
are spread over multiple agents. in order to appropriately order
and structure the negotiations occurring in the chain so as to 
optimize the expected utility, we present an extension to a 
singleagent concurrent negotiation framework. this work is aimed at
semi-cooperative multi-agent systems, where each agent has its
own goals and works to maximize its local utility; however, the 
performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agent"s
cooperation and the system"s overall performance. we introduce
a pre-negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta-level
information. using this information, the agent can build a more
accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the 
relationship of flexibility and success probability. this more accurate
model helps the agent in choosing a better negotiation solution in
the global negotiation chain context. the agent can also use this 
information to allocate appropriate time for each negotiation, hence
to find a good ordering of all related negotiations. the 
experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agents" and the
system"s overall performance significantly.
