in many settings, competing technologies - for example, 
operating systems, instant messenger systems, or document 
formatscan be seen adopting a limited amount of compatibility with one 
another; in other words, the difficulty in using multiple technologies
is balanced somewhere between the two extremes of impossibility
and effortless interoperability. there are a range of reasons why
this phenomenon occurs, many of which - based on legal, social,
or business considerations - seem to defy concise mathematical
models. despite this, we show that the advantages of limited 
compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social
networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in
purely strategic terms.
our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in
the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new 
technology a might spread through a social network of individuals who
are currently users of technology b. we consider several ways of
capturing the compatibility of a and b, focusing primarily on a
model in which users can choose to adopt a, adopt b, or - at an
extra cost - adopt both a and b. we characterize how the 
ability of a to spread depends on both its quality relative to b, and
also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising
non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these 
parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction
of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced
within a narrow, intermediate range. we also extend the framework
to the case of multiple technologies, where we find that a simple
