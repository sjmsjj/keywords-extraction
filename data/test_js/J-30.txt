while traditional mechanism design typically assumes 
isomorphism between the agents" type- and action spaces, in
many situations the agents face strict restrictions on their
action space due to, e.g., technical, behavioral or regulatory
reasons. we devise a general framework for the study of
mechanism design in single-parameter environments with 
restricted action spaces. our contribution is threefold. first,
we characterize sufficient conditions under which the 
information-theoretically optimal social-choice rule can be 
implemented in dominant strategies, and prove that any 
multilinear social-choice rule is dominant-strategy implementable
with no additional cost. second, we identify necessary 
conditions for the optimality of action-bounded mechanisms, and
fully characterize the optimal mechanisms and strategies in
games with two players and two alternatives. finally, we
prove that for any multilinear social-choice rule, the optimal
mechanism with k actions incurs an expected loss of o( 1
k2 )
compared to the optimal mechanisms with unrestricted 
action spaces. our results apply to various economic and 
computational settings, and we demonstrate their applicability
to signaling games, public-good models and routing in 
networks.
