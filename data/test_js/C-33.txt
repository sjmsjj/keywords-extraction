how to provide appropriate context information is a 
challenging problem in context-aware computing. most existing
approaches use a centralized selection mechanism to decide
which context information is appropriate. in this paper, we
propose a novel approach based on negotiation with rewards
to solving such problem. distributed context providers 
negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context
and how they allocate proceeds. in order to support our
approach, we have designed a concrete negotiation model
with rewards. we also evaluate our approach and show that
it indeed can choose an appropriate context provider and
allocate the proceeds fairly.
