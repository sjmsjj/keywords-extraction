we investigate a framework where agents search for 
satisfying products by using referrals from other agents. our
model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and
the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a
module governing the local behaviour of agents with a 
module governing the structure and function of the underlying
network of agents. local behaviour incorporates a 
satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the 
interactions between agents, including learning about the 
trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints
on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or
switching costs. local behaviour takes place on a network
substrate across which agents exchange positive and 
negative information about products. we use various degree
distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and 
incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential
attachment in our network models. we compare the 
effectiveness of referral systems over various network structures
for easy and hard choice tasks, and evaluate how this 
effectiveness changes with the imposition of market barriers.
