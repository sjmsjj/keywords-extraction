human team members often develop shared expectations to
predict each other"s needs and coordinate their behaviors.
in this paper the concept shared belief map is proposed
as a basis for developing realistic shared expectations among
a team of human-agent-pairs (haps). the establishment
of shared belief maps relies on inter-agent information 
sharing, the effectiveness of which highly depends on agents" 
processing loads and the instantaneous cognitive loads of their
human partners. we investigate hmm-based cognitive load
models to facilitate team members to share the right 
information with the right party at the right time. the shared
belief map concept and the cognitive/processing load models
have been implemented in a cognitive agent 
architecturesmmall. a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate
the concept, the models, and their impacts on the evolving
of shared mental models of hap teams.
