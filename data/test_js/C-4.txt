best effort packet-switched networks, like the internet, do
not offer a reliable transmission of packets to applications
with real-time constraints such as voice. thus, the loss of
packets impairs the application-level utility. for voice this
utility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts
of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the
receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal 
playout is interrupted. on the other hand, some packets may
be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important
information in terms of user perception than other packets.
we first develop an end-to-end model based on loss 
runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution
within a flow. these packet-level metrics are then linked to
user-level objective speech quality metrics. using this 
framework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based codecs
(pcm) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be
concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual
impact. for high-compressing frame-based codecs (g.729)
on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error
propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though
on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss
concealment by extrapolation of decoder state. contrary to
sample-based codecs we show that the concealment 
performance may break at transitions within the speech signal
however.
we then propose mechanisms which differentiate between
packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of
packet loss. we designate these methods as intra-flow loss
recovery and control. at the end-to-end level, identification
of packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss 
concealment (receiver) takes place. hop-by-hop support schemes
then allow to (statistically) trade the loss of one packet,
which is considered more important, against another one of
the same flow which is of lower importance. as both 
packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission,
a gain in user perception is obtainable. we show that 
significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and
additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while
still maintaining a network service which is virtually 
identical to best effort in the long term.
