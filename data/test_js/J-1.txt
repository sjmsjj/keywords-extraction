when designing a mechanism there are several desirable
properties to maintain such as incentive compatibility (ic),
individual rationality (ir), and budget balance (bb). it is
well known [15] that it is impossible for a mechanism to
maximize social welfare whilst also being ir, ic, and bb.
there have been several attempts to circumvent [15] by 
trading welfare for bb, e.g., in domains such as double-sided
auctions[13], distributed markets[3] and supply chain 
problems[2, 4].
in this paper we provide a procedure called a 
generalized trade reduction (gtr) for single-value players, which
given an ir and ic mechanism, outputs a mechanism which
is ir, ic and bb with a loss of welfare. we bound the
welfare achieved by our procedure for a wide range of 
domains. in particular, our results improve on existing 
solutions for problems such as double sided markets with 
homogenous goods, distributed markets and several kinds of
supply chains. furthermore, our solution provides 
budget balanced mechanisms for several open problems such as
combinatorial double-sided auctions and distributed 
markets with strategic transportation edges.
