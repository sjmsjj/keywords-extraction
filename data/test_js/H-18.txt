topic detection and tracking [26] and topic segmentation
[15] play an important role in capturing the local and 
sequential information of documents. previous work in this
area usually focuses on single documents, although similar
multiple documents are available in many domains. in this
paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method for shared
topic detection and topic segmentation of multiple similar
documents based on mutual information (mi) and weighted
mutual information (wmi) that is a combination of mi and
term weights. the basic idea is that the optimal 
segmentation maximizes mi(or wmi). our approach can detect
shared topics among documents. it can find the optimal
boundaries in a document, and align segments among 
documents at the same time. it also can handle single-document
segmentation as a special case of the multi-document 
segmentation and alignment. our methods can identify and
strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and
partially remove stop words by using term weights based on
entropy learned from multiple documents. our experimental
results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of
single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and
multi-document segmentation. utilizing information from
multiple documents can tremendously improve the 
performance of topic segmentation, and using wmi is even better
than using mi for the multi-document segmentation.
