this paper proposes a new variant of the task allocation
problem, where the agents are connected in a social network
and tasks arrive at the agents distributed over the network.
we show that the complexity of this problem remains 
nphard. moreover, it is not approximable within some factor.
we develop an algorithm based on the contract-net 
protocol. our algorithm is completely distributed, and it assumes
that agents have only local knowledge about tasks and 
resources. we conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the
performance and scalability of the proposed algorithm in
terms of solution quality and computation time. three 
different types of networks, namely small-world, random and
scale-free networks, are used to represent various social 
relationships among agents in realistic applications. the results
demonstrate that our algorithm works well and that it scales
well to large-scale applications.
