multiagent environments are often not cooperative nor 
collaborative; in many cases, agents have conflicting interests,
leading to adversarial interactions. this paper presents a
formal adversarial environment model for bounded 
rational agents operating in a zero-sum environment. in such
environments, attempts to use classical utility-based search
methods can raise a variety of difficulties (e.g., implicitly
modeling the opponent as an omniscient utility maximizer,
rather than leveraging a more nuanced, explicit opponent
model).
we define an adversarial environment by describing the
mental states of an agent in such an environment. we then
present behavioral axioms that are intended to serve as 
design principles for building such adversarial agents. we 
explore the application of our approach by analyzing log files
of completed connect-four games, and present an empirical
analysis of the axioms" appropriateness.
