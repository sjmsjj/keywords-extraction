for allocation problems with one or more items, the 
wellknown vickrey-clarke-groves (vcg) mechanism is efficient,
strategy-proof, individually rational, and does not incur a
deficit. however, the vcg mechanism is not (strongly)
budget balanced: generally, the agents" payments will sum
to more than 0. if there is an auctioneer who is selling
the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus 
payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer. however, if
the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely
interested in allocating the items efficiently among 
themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will
have to flow out of the system of agents. in 2006, 
cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of
the vcg payment back to the agents, while maintaining
efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the
non-deficit property. in this paper, we extend this result in a
restricted setting. we study allocation settings where there
are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and
agents have unit demand. (for this specific setting, 
cavallo"s mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by
bailey in 1997 [2].) here we propose a family of mechanisms
that redistribute some of the vcg payment back to the
agents. all mechanisms in the family are efficient, 
strategyproof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit. the
family includes the bailey-cavallo mechanism as a special
case. we then provide an optimization model for finding the
optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes
redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and show
how to cast this model as a linear program. we give both
numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program,
and the (unique) resulting mechanism shows significant 
improvement over the bailey-cavallo mechanism (in the worst
case). finally, we prove that the obtained mechanism is 
optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms that
satisfy the above properties.
