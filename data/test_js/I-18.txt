the paper deals with on-board planning for a satellite swarm
via communication and negotiation. we aim at defining 
individual behaviours that result in a global behaviour that
meets the mission requirements. we will present the 
formalization of the problem, a communication protocol, a solving
method based on reactive decision rules, and first results.
