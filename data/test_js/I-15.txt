finding the right agents in a large and dynamic network to
provide the needed resources in a timely fashion, is a long
standing problem. this paper presents a method for information
searching and sharing that combines routing indices with 
tokenbased methods. the proposed method enables agents to search
effectively by acquiring their neighbors" interests, advertising
their information provision abilities and maintaining indices for
routing queries, in an integrated way. specifically, the paper
demonstrates through performance experiments how static and
dynamic networks of agents can be â€˜tuned" to answer queries
effectively as they gather evidence for the interests and
information provision abilities of others, without altering the
topology or imposing an overlay structure to the network of
acquaintances.
