a significant concern for internet-based service providers is the
continued operation and availability of services in the face of 
outages, whether planned or unplanned. in this paper we advocate
a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration
across wans to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner. we
specifically seek to achieve high availability of data center services
in the face of both planned and unanticipated outages of data center
facilities. we make use of server virtualization technologies to 
enable the replication and migration of server functions. we propose
new network functions to enable server migration and replication
across wide area networks (e.g., the internet), and finally show the
utility of intelligent and dynamic storage replication technology to
ensure applications have access to data in the face of outages with
very tight recovery point objectives.
