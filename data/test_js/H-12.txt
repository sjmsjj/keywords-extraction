the presentation of query biased document snippets as part
of results pages presented by search engines has become an
expectation of search engine users. in this paper we 
explore the algorithms and data structures required as part of
a search engine to allow efficient generation of query biased
snippets. we begin by proposing and analysing a document
compression method that reduces snippet generation time
by 58% over a baseline using the zlib compression library.
these experiments reveal that finding documents on 
secondary storage dominates the total cost of generating 
snippets, and so caching documents in ram is essential for a
fast snippet generation process. using simulation, we 
examine snippet generation performance for different size ram
caches. finally we propose and analyse document 
reordering and compaction, revealing a scheme that increases the
number of document cache hits with only a marginal 
affect on snippet quality. this scheme effectively doubles the
number of documents that can fit in a fixed size cache.
