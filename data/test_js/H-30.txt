query expansion, in the form of pseudo-relevance feedback
or relevance feedback, is a common technique used to 
improve retrieval effectiveness. most previous approaches have
ignored important issues, such as the role of features and the
importance of modeling term dependencies. in this paper,
we propose a robust query expansion technique based on
the markov random field model for information retrieval.
the technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a
mechanism for modeling term dependencies during 
expansion. furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the
model provides a powerful framework for going beyond 
simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by
most other expansion techniques. we evaluate our 
technique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language
modeling query expansion technique. our model 
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval
effectiveness across several trec data sets. we also 
describe how our technique can be used to generate 
meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query 
suggestion/reformulation.
