conflex-g is the grid-enabled version of a molecular 
conformational space search program called conflex. we
have implemented conflex-g using a grid rpc system
called omnirpc. in this paper, we report the performance
of conflex-g in a grid testbed of several geographically
distributed pc clusters. in order to explore many 
conformation of large bio-molecules, conflex-g generates
trial structures of the molecules and allocates jobs to 
optimize a trial structure with a reliable molecular mechanics
method in the grid. omnirpc provides a restricted 
persistence model to support the parametric search applications.
in this model, when the initialization procedure is defined
in the rpc module, the module is automatically 
initialized at the time of invocation by calling the initialization
procedure. this can eliminate unnecessary communication
and initialization at each call in conflex-g. 
conflexg can achieve performance comparable to conflex mpi
and can exploit more computing resources by allowing the
use of a cluster of multiple clusters in the grid. the 
experimental result shows that conflex-g achieved a speedup
of 56.5 times in the case of the 1bl1 molecule, where the
molecule consists of a large number of atoms, and each trial
structure optimization requires significant time. the load
imbalance of the optimization time of the trial structure
may also cause performance degradation.
