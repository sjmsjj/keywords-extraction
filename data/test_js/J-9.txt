according to economic theory-supported by empirical and
laboratory evidence-the equilibrium price of a financial 
security reflects all of the information regarding the security"s
value. we investigate the computational process on the path
toward equilibrium, where information distributed among
traders is revealed step-by-step over time and incorporated
into the market price. we develop a simplified model of an
information market, along with trading strategies, in order
to formalize the computational properties of the process.
we show that securities whose payoffs cannot be expressed
as weighted threshold functions of distributed input bits are
not guaranteed to converge to the proper equilibrium 
predicted by economic theory. on the other hand, securities
whose payoffs are threshold functions are guaranteed to 
converge, for all prior probability distributions. moreover, these
threshold securities converge in at most n rounds, where n
is the number of bits of distributed information. we also
prove a lower bound, showing a type of threshold security
that requires at least n/2 rounds to converge in the worst
case.
