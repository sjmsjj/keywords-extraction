personal information management (pim) is a rapidly 
growing area of research concerned with how people store, 
manage and re-find information. a feature of pim research is
that many systems have been designed to assist users 
manage and re-find information, but very few have been 
evaluated. this has been noted by several scholars and explained
by the difficulties involved in performing pim evaluations.
the difficulties include that people re-find information from
within unique personal collections; researchers know little
about the tasks that cause people to re-find information;
and numerous privacy issues concerning personal 
information. in this paper we aim to facilitate pim evaluations by
addressing each of these difficulties. in the first part, we
present a diary study of information re-finding tasks. the
study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find
information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks
for email messages and web pages. in the second part, we
propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our
findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using
two different methods of task creation.
