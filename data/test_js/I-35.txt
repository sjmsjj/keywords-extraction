norms are widely recognised as a means of coordinating
multi-agent systems. the distributed management of norms
is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly 
distributed computational realisations of normative models. in
order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that
take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a 
normative model, the normative structure (ns), an artifact that
is based on the propagation of normative positions 
(obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents"
actions. within a ns, conflicts may arise due to the dynamic
nature of the mas and the concurrency of agents" actions.
however, ensuring conflict-freedom of a ns at design time
is computationally intractable. we show this by 
formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of nss into
coloured petri nets and borrowing well-known theoretical
results from that field. since online conflict resolution is
required, we present a tractable algorithm to be employed
distributedly. we then demonstrate that this algorithm is
paramount for the distributed enactment of a ns.
