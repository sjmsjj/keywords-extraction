in recent years, overlay networks have become an effective 
alternative to ip multicast for efficient point to multipoint 
communication across the internet. typically, nodes self-organize with the
goal of forming an efficient overlay tree, one that meets 
performance targets without placing undue burden on the underlying
network. in this paper, we target high-bandwidth data 
distribution from a single source to a large number of receivers. 
applications include large-file transfers and real-time multimedia 
streaming. for these applications, we argue that an overlay mesh, rather
than a tree, can deliver fundamentally higher bandwidth and 
reliability relative to typical tree structures. this paper presents
bullet, a scalable and distributed algorithm that enables nodes
spread across the internet to self-organize into a high bandwidth
overlay mesh. we construct bullet around the insight that data
should be distributed in a disjoint manner to strategic points in
the network. individual bullet receivers are then responsible for
locating and retrieving the data from multiple points in parallel.
key contributions of this work include: i) an algorithm that
sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data
object is equally likely to appear at any node, ii) a scalable and
decentralized algorithm that allows nodes to locate and recover
missing data items, and iii) a complete implementation and 
evaluation of bullet running across the internet and in a large-scale
emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth 
improvements under a variety of circumstances. in addition, we find
that, relative to tree-based solutions, bullet reduces the need to
perform expensive bandwidth probing. in a tree, it is critical that
a node"s parent delivers a high rate of application data to each
child. in bullet however, nodes simultaneously receive data from
multiple sources in parallel, making it less important to locate
any single source capable of sustaining a high transmission rate.
