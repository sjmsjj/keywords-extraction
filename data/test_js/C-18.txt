the slammer, which is currently the fastest computer worm
in recorded history, was observed to infect 90 percent of all
vulnerable internets hosts within 10 minutes. although the
main action that the slammer worm takes is a relatively 
unsophisticated replication of itself, it still spreads so quickly
that human response was ineffective. most proposed 
countermeasures strategies are based primarily on rate detection
and limiting algorithms. however, such strategies are being
designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose
behaviors are similar to that of slammer.
in our work, we put forth the hypothesis that next 
generation worms will be radically different, and potentially
such techniques will prove ineffective. specifically, we 
propose to study a new generation of worms called swarm
worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of
emergent intelligence. emergent intelligence is the 
behavior of systems, very much like biological systems such as
ants or bees, where simple local interactions of autonomous
members, with simple primitive actions, gives rise to 
complex and intelligent global behavior. in this manuscript we
will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of swarm
worms, as well as the basic structure required in order to
be considered a swarm worm. in addition, we will present
preliminary results on the propagation speeds of one such
swarm worm, called the zachik worm. we will show that
zachik is capable of propagating at a rate 2 orders of 
magnitude faster than similar worms without swarm capabilities.
