internet search companies sell advertisement slots based on
users" search queries via an auction. while there has been
previous work on the auction process and its game-theoretic
aspects, most of it focuses on the internet company. in this
work, we focus on the advertisers, who must solve a complex
optimization problem to decide how to place bids on 
keywords to maximize their return (the number of user clicks on
their ads) for a given budget. we model the entire process
and study this budget optimization problem. while most
variants are np-hard, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that
simply randomizing between two uniform strategies that bid
equally on all the keywords works well. more precisely, this
strategy gets at least a 1 âˆ’ 1/e fraction of the maximum
clicks possible. as our preliminary experiments show, such
uniform strategies are likely to be practical. we also present
inapproximability results, and optimal algorithms for 
variants of the budget optimization problem.
