security schemes of pairwise key establishment, which enable
sensors to communicate with each other securely, play a
fundamental role in research on security issue in wireless sensor
networks. a new kind of cluster deployed sensor networks
distribution model is presented, and based on which, an
innovative hierarchical hypercube model - h(k,u,m,v,n) and the
mapping relationship between cluster deployed sensor networks
and the h(k,u,m,v,n) are proposed. by utilizing nice properties of
h(k,u,m,v,n) model, a new general framework for pairwise key
predistribution and a new pairwise key establishment algorithm
are designed, which combines the idea of kdc(key distribution
center) and polynomial pool schemes. furthermore, the working
performance of the newly proposed pairwise key establishment
algorithm is seriously inspected. theoretic analysis and
experimental figures show that the new algorithm has better
performance and provides higher possibilities for sensor to
establish pairwise key, compared with previous related works.
