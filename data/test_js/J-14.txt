this paper addresses the problem of fair equilibrium selection in
graphical games. our approach is based on the data structure called
the best response policy, which was proposed by kearns et al. [13]
as a way to represent all nash equilibria of a graphical game. in [9],
it was shown that the best response policy has polynomial size as
long as the underlying graph is a path. in this paper, we show
that if the underlying graph is a bounded-degree tree and the best
response policy has polynomial size then there is an efficient 
algorithm which constructs a nash equilibrium that guarantees certain
payoffs to all participants. another attractive solution concept is a
nash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare. we show that,
while exactly computing the latter is infeasible (we prove that 
solving this problem may involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily
high degree), there exists an fptas for finding such an equilibrium
as long as the best response policy has polynomial size. these two
algorithms can be combined to produce nash equilibria that satisfy
various fairness criteria.
