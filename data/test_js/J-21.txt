information markets, which are designed specifically to 
aggregate traders" information, are becoming increasingly 
popular as a means for predicting future events. recent 
research in information markets has resulted in two new 
designs, market scoring rules and dynamic parimutuel 
markets. we develop an analytic method to guide the design
and strategic analysis of information markets. our central
contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection
game, that serves as a useful model for information 
markets. we demonstrate that this game can serve as a strategic
model of dynamic parimutuel markets, and also captures the
essence of the strategies in market scoring rules. the 
projection game is tractable to analyze, and has an attractive
geometric visualization that makes the strategic moves and
interactions more transparent. we use it to prove several
strategic properties about the dynamic parimutuel market.
we also prove that a special form of the projection game is
strategically equivalent to the spherical scoring rule, and it
is strategically similar to other scoring rules. finally, we 
illustrate two applications of the model to analysis of complex
strategic scenarios: we analyze the precision of a market in
which traders have inertia, and a market in which a trader
can profit by manipulating another trader"s beliefs.
