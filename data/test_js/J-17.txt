we consider the problem of makespan minimization on m
unrelated machines in the context of algorithmic mechanism
design, where the machines are the strategic players. this is
a multidimensional scheduling domain, and the only known
positive results for makespan minimization in such a domain
are o(m)-approximation truthful mechanisms [22, 20]. we
study a well-motivated special case of this problem, where
the processing time of a job on each machine may either
be low or high, and the low and high values are public
and job-dependent. this preserves the 
multidimensionality of the domain, and generalizes the restricted-machines
(i.e., {pj, âˆž}) setting in scheduling. we give a general 
technique to convert any c-approximation algorithm to a 
3capproximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. this is
one of the few known results that shows how to export 
approximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into
truthful mechanisms in a black-box fashion. when the low
and high values are the same for all jobs, we devise a 
deterministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism. these are
the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance
guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain.
our constructions are novel in two respects. first, we
do not utilize or rely on explicit price definitions to prove
truthfulness; instead we design algorithms that satisfy 
cycle monotonicity. cycle monotonicity [23] is a necessary
and sufficient condition for truthfulness, is a generalization
of value monotonicity for multidimensional domains. 
however, whereas value monotonicity has been used extensively
and successfully to design truthful mechanisms in 
singledimensional domains, ours is the first work that leverages
cycle monotonicity in the multidimensional setting. second,
our randomized mechanisms are obtained by first 
constructing a fractional truthful mechanism for a fractional 
relaxation of the problem, and then converting it into a 
truthfulin-expectation mechanism. this builds upon a technique
of [16], and shows the usefulness of fractional mechanisms
in truthful mechanism design.
