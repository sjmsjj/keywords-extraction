machine learning is commonly used to improve ranked 
retrieval systems. due to computational difficulties, few 
learning techniques have been developed to directly optimize for
mean average precision (map), despite its widespread use
in evaluating such systems. existing approaches 
optimizing map either do not find a globally optimal solution,
or are computationally expensive. in contrast, we present
a general svm learning algorithm that efficiently finds a
globally optimal solution to a straightforward relaxation of
map. we evaluate our approach using the trec 9 and
trec 10 web track corpora (wt10g), comparing against
svms optimized for accuracy and rocarea. in most cases
we show our method to produce statistically significant 
improvements in map scores.
