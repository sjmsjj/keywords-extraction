this paper presents a simple and scalable framework for 
architecting peer-to-peer overlays called peer-to-peer 
receiverdriven overlay (or pro). pro is designed for non-interactive
streaming applications and its primary design goal is to 
maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to
peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth. to
achieve this goal, pro adopts a receiver-driven approach
where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently
discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and
(ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through
which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own 
delivered bandwidth. participating peers form an 
unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate.
furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled
bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and
react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition
without any explicit coordination with other participating
peers. independent parent selection by individual peers 
dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure.
