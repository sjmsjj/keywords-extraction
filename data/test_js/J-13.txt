the winner determination problem in combinatorial 
auctions is the problem of determining the allocation of the
items among the bidders that maximizes the sum of the
accepted bid prices. while this problem is in general 
nphard, it is known to be feasible in polynomial time on
those instances whose associated item graphs have bounded
treewidth (called structured item graphs). formally, an item
graph is a graph whose nodes are in one-to-one 
correspondence with items, and edges are such that for any bid, the
items occurring in it induce a connected subgraph. note
that many item graphs might be associated with a given
combinatorial auction, depending on the edges selected for
guaranteeing the connectedness. in fact, the tractability
of determining whether a structured item graph of a fixed
treewidth exists (and if so, computing one) was left as a
crucial open problem.
in this paper, we solve this problem by proving that the
existence of a structured item graph is computationally 
intractable, even for treewidth 3. motivated by this bad news,
we investigate different kinds of structural requirements that
can be used to isolate tractable classes of combinatorial 
auctions. we show that the notion of hypertree decomposition,
a recently introduced measure of hypergraph cyclicity, turns
out to be most useful here. indeed, we show that the 
winner determination problem is solvable in polynomial time
on instances whose bidder interactions can be represented
with (dual) hypergraphs having bounded hypertree width.
even more surprisingly, we show that the class of tractable
instances identified by means of our approach properly 
contains the class of instances having a structured item graph.
