making commitments, e.g., through promises and threats, enables a
player to exploit the strengths of his own strategic position as well
as the weaknesses of that of his opponents. which commitments
a player can make with credibility depends on the circumstances.
in some, a player can only commit to the performance of an 
action, in others, he can commit himself conditionally on the actions
of the other players. some situations even allow for commitments
on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions. we
explore the formal properties of these types of (conditional) 
commitment and their interrelationships. so as to preclude 
inconsistencies among conditional commitments, we assume an order in
which the players make their commitments. central to our 
analyses is the notion of an extortion, which we define, for a given order
of the players, as a profile that contains, for each player, an optimal
commitment given the commitments of the players that committed
earlier. on this basis, we investigate for different commitment types
whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later, and
how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to backward
induction and pareto efficiency.
