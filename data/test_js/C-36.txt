publish/subscribe systems provide an efficient, event-based,
wide-area distributed communications infrastructure. large
scale publish/subscribe systems are likely to employ 
components of the event transport network owned by cooperating,
but independent organisations. as the number of 
participants in the network increases, security becomes an 
increasing concern. this paper extends previous work to present
and evaluate a secure multi-domain publish/subscribe 
infrastructure that supports and enforces fine-grained access
control over the individual attributes of event types. key
refresh allows us to ensure forward and backward security
when event brokers join and leave the network. we 
demonstrate that the time and space overheads can be minimised
by careful consideration of encryption techniques, and by
the use of caching to decrease unnecessary decryptions. we
show that our approach has a smaller overall 
communication overhead than existing approaches for achieving the
same degree of control over security in publish/subscribe
networks.
