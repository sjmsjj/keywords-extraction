a content-based personalized recommendation system learns
user specific profiles from user feedback so that it can deliver
information tailored to each individual user"s interest. a 
system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile
for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing
information from other users through the use of a bayesian
hierarchical model. learning the model parameters to 
optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very
computationally expensive. the commonly used em 
algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data
in ir applications. this paper proposes a new fast learning
technique to learn a large number of individual user 
profiles. the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm
are justified by theory and demonstrated on actual user data
from netflix and movielens.
