effective organization of search results is critical for 
improving the utility of any search engine. clustering search results
is an effective way to organize search results, which allows
a user to navigate into relevant documents quickly. 
however, two deficiencies of this approach make it not always
work well: (1) the clusters discovered do not necessarily
correspond to the interesting aspects of a topic from the
user"s perspective; and (2) the cluster labels generated are
not informative enough to allow a user to identify the right
cluster. in this paper, we propose to address these two 
deficiencies by (1) learning interesting aspects of a topic from
web search logs and organizing search results accordingly;
and (2) generating more meaningful cluster labels using past
query words entered by users. we evaluate our proposed
method on a commercial search engine log data. compared
with the traditional methods of clustering search results, our
method can give better result organization and more 
meaningful labels.
