multiattribute auction mechanisms generally either remain 
agnostic about traders" preferences, or presume highly restrictive forms,
such as full additivity. real preferences often exhibit 
dependencies among attributes, yet may possess some structure that can be
usefully exploited to streamline communication and simplify 
operation of a multiattribute auction. we develop such a structure
using the theory of measurable value functions, a cardinal utility
representation based on an underlying order over preference 
differences. a set of local conditional independence relations over
such differences supports a generalized additive preference 
representation, which decomposes utility across overlapping clusters of
related attributes. we introduce an iterative auction mechanism that
maintains prices on local clusters of attributes rather than the full
space of joint configurations. when traders" preferences are 
consistent with the auction"s generalized additive structure, the 
mechanism produces approximately optimal allocations, at approximate
vcg prices.
