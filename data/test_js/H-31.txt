many variants of language models have been proposed for
information retrieval. most existing models are based on
multinomial distribution and would score documents based
on query likelihood computed based on a query generation
probabilistic model. in this paper, we propose and study a
new family of query generation models based on poisson 
distribution. we show that while in their simplest forms, the
new family of models and the existing multinomial models
are equivalent, they behave differently for many smoothing
methods. we show that the poisson model has several 
advantages over the multinomial model, including naturally 
accommodating per-term smoothing and allowing for more 
accurate background modeling. we present several variants of
the new model corresponding to different smoothing 
methods, and evaluate them on four representative trec test
collections. the results show that while their basic 
models perform comparably, the poisson model can outperform
multinomial model with per-term smoothing. the 
performance can be further improved with two-stage smoothing.
