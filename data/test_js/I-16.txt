in this paper we present an advanced bidding agent that 
participates in first-price sealed bid auctions to allocate advertising space
on bluscreen - an experimental public advertisement system that
detects users through the presence of their bluetooth enabled 
devices. our bidding agent is able to build probabilistic models of
both the behaviour of users who view the adverts, and the auctions
that it participates within. it then uses these models to maximise the
exposure that its adverts receive. we evaluate the effectiveness of
this bidding agent through simulation against a range of alternative
selection mechanisms including a simple bidding strategy, random
allocation, and a centralised optimal allocation with perfect 
foresight. our bidding agent significantly outperforms both the simple
bidding strategy and the random allocation, and in a mixed 
population of agents it is able to expose its adverts to 25% more users than
the simple bidding strategy. moreover, its performance is within
7.5% of that of the centralised optimal allocation despite the highly
uncertain environment in which it must operate.
