relevance feedback is a powerful technique to enhance 
contentbased image retrieval (cbir) performance. it solicits the
user"s relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned
by the cbir systems. the user"s labeling is then used to
learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and 
irrelevant images. however, the top returned images may not be
the most informative ones. the challenge is thus to 
determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative
(i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled
and used as training samples. in this paper, we propose
a novel active learning algorithm, called laplacian 
optimal design (lod), for relevance feedback image retrieval.
our algorithm is based on a regression model which 
minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled)
images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical
structure of the image space. specifically, we assume that
if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their
measurements (or, labels) are close as well. by constructing
a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the
image space can be described by the graph laplacian. we
discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental
design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of 
images, which gives us the most amount of information. 
experimental results on corel database suggest that the proposed
approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback 
image retrieval.
