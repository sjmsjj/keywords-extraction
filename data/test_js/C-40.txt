newly emerging game-based application systems such as second
life1
provide 3d virtual environments where multiple users 
interact with each other in real-time. they are filled with autonomous,
mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the
users. to make the systems highly scalable and dynamically 
extensible, they are usually built on a client-server based grid subspace
division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable
sub-worlds. in each sub-world, the user continuously receives
relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely 
connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint, rather
than retrieving them from a local storage medium.
in such systems, the determination of the set of objects that are
visible from a user"s viewpoint is one of the primary factors that
affect server throughput and scalability. specifically, performing
real-time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments
is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub-millions of
active users are moving and interacting. we recognize that the 
described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem,
and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space
to a set of multi-dimensional objects in a spatial database while
modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query.
unfortunately, existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for
this kind of new environments.
the main goal of this paper is to present an efficient spatial 
index structure that minimizes unexpected object popping and 
supports highly scalable real-time visibility determination. we then
uncover many useful properties of this structure and compare the
index structure with various spatial indexing methods in terms of
query quality, system throughput, and resource utilization. we 
expect our approach to lay the groundwork for next-generation 
virtual frameworks that may merge into existing web-based services
in the near future.
