operational transformation (ot) is a technique for 
consistency maintenance and group undo, and is being applied
to an increasing number of collaborative applications. the
theoretical foundation for ot is crucial in determining its
capability to solve existing and new problems, as well as
the quality of those solutions. the theory of causality has
been the foundation of all prior ot systems, but it is 
inadequate to capture essential correctness requirements. past
research had invented various patches to work around this
problem, resulting in increasingly intricate and complicated
ot algorithms. after having designed, implemented, and
experimented with a series of ot algorithms, we reflected
on what had been learned and set out to develop a new 
theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving
ot problems, reducing its complexity, and supporting its
continual evolution. in this paper, we report the main 
results of this effort: the theory of operation context and the
cot (context-based ot) algorithm. the cot algorithm
is capable of supporting both do and undo of any 
operations at anytime, without requiring transformation functions
to preserve reversibility property, convergence property 2,
inverse properties 2 and 3. the cot algorithm is not only
simpler and more efficient than prior ot control algorithms,
but also simplifies the design of transformation functions.
we have implemented the cot algorithm in a generic 
collaboration engine and used it for supporting a range of novel
collaborative applications.
