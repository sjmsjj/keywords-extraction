a mediator is a reliable entity, which can play on behalf of
agents in a given game. a mediator however can not enforce
the use of its services, and each agent is free to participate
in the game directly. in this paper we introduce a study of
mediators for games with incomplete information, and 
apply it to the context of position auctions, a central topic
in electronic commerce. vcg position auctions, which are
currently not used in practice, possess some nice 
theoretical properties, such as the optimization of social surplus
and having dominant strategies. these properties may not
be satisfied by current position auctions and their variants.
we therefore concentrate on the search for mediators that
will allow to transform current position auctions into vcg
position auctions. we require that accepting the 
mediator services, and reporting honestly to the mediator, will
form an ex post equilibrium, which satisfies the following
rationality condition: an agent"s payoff can not be negative
regardless of the actions taken by the agents who did not
choose the mediator"s services, or by the agents who report
false types to the mediator. we prove the existence of such
desired mediators for the next-price (google-like) position
auctions, as well as for a richer class of position auctions,
including all k-price position auctions, k > 1. for k=1, the
self-price position auction, we show that the existence of
such mediator depends on the tie breaking rule used in the
auction.
