keyword auctions lie at the core of the business models of
today"s leading search engines. advertisers bid for 
placement alongside search results, and are charged for clicks on
their ads. advertisers are typically ranked according to a
score that takes into account their bids and potential 
clickthrough rates. we consider a family of ranking rules that
contains those typically used to model yahoo! and google"s
auction designs as special cases. we find that in general
neither of these is necessarily revenue-optimal in 
equilibrium, and that the choice of ranking rule can be guided
by considering the correlation between bidders" values and
click-through rates. we propose a simple approach to 
determine a revenue-optimal ranking rule within our family, 
taking into account effects on advertiser satisfaction and user
experience. we illustrate the approach using monte-carlo
simulations based on distributions fitted to yahoo! bid and
click-through rate data for a high-volume keyword.
