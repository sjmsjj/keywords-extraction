grids are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. one important
problem in grid computing is resource selection, that is, finding
an appropriate resource set for the application. another problem
is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid 
environment. existing solutions to these two problems require that a 
performance model for an application is known. however, 
constructing such models is a complex task. in this paper, we investigate
an approach that does not require performance models. we start an
application on any set of resources. during the application run, we
periodically collect the statistics about the application run and 
deduce application requirements from these statistics. then, we adjust
the resource set to better fit the application needs. this approach 
allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks, such as overloaded wan
links or very slow processors, and therefore can yield significant
performance improvements. we evaluate our approach in a number
of scenarios typical for the grid.
