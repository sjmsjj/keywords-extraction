the convergence of advances in storage, encoding, and networking
technologies has brought us to an environment where huge amounts
of continuous media content is routinely stored and exchanged 
between network enabled devices. keeping track of (or managing)
such content remains challenging due to the sheer volume of data.
storing live continuous media (such as tv or radio content) adds
to the complexity in that this content has no well defined start or
end and is therefore cumbersome to deal with. networked storage
allows content that is logically viewed as part of the same collection
to in fact be distributed across a network, making the task of 
content management all but impossible to deal with without a content
management system. in this paper we present the design and 
implementation of the spectrum content management system, which
deals with rich media content effectively in this environment.
spectrum has a modular architecture that allows its application
to both stand-alone and various networked scenarios. a unique 
aspect of spectrum is that it requires one (or more) retention policies
to apply to every piece of content that is stored in the system. this
means that there are no eviction policies. content that no longer
has a retention policy applied to it is simply removed from the 
system. different retention policies can easily be applied to the same
content thus naturally facilitating sharing without duplication. this
approach also allows spectrum to easily apply time based policies
which are basic building blocks required to deal with the storage of
live continuous media, to content. we not only describe the details
of the spectrum architecture but also give typical use cases.
