we consider the problem of analyzing word trajectories in
both time and frequency domains, with the specific goal of
identifying important and less-reported, periodic and 
aperiodic words. a set of words with identical trends can be
grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely 
unsupervised manner. the document frequency of each word
across time is treated like a time series, where each element
is the document frequency - inverse document frequency
(dfidf) score at one time point. in this paper, we 1) first
applied spectral analysis to categorize features for different
event characteristics: important and less-reported, periodic
and aperiodic; 2) modeled aperiodic features with gaussian
density and periodic features with gaussian mixture 
densities, and subsequently detected each feature"s burst by the
truncated gaussian approach; 3) proposed an unsupervised
greedy event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic
and periodic events. all of the above methods can be 
applied to time series data in general. we extensively 
evaluated our methods on the 1-year reuters news corpus [3] and
showed that they were able to uncover meaningful aperiodic
and periodic events.
