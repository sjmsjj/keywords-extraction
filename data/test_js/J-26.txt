much recent research concerns systems, such as the 
internet, whose components are owned and operated by different
parties, each with his own selfish goal. the field of 
algorithmic mechanism design handles the issue of private 
information held by the different parties in such computational
settings. this paper deals with a complementary problem in
such settings: handling the hidden actions that are 
performed by the different parties.
our model is a combinatorial variant of the classical 
principalagent problem from economic theory. in our setting a 
principal must motivate a team of strategic agents to exert costly
effort on his behalf, but their actions are hidden from him.
our focus is on cases where complex combinations of the
efforts of the agents influence the outcome. the principal
motivates the agents by offering to them a set of contracts,
which together put the agents in an equilibrium point of the
induced game. we present formal models for this setting,
suggest and embark on an analysis of some basic issues, but
leave many questions open.
