in a wide range of markets, individual buyers and sellers often trade
through intermediaries, who determine prices via strategic 
considerations. typically, not all buyers and sellers have access to the
same intermediaries, and they trade at correspondingly different
prices that reflect their relative amounts of power in the market.
we model this phenomenon using a game in which buyers, 
sellers, and traders engage in trade on a graph that represents the access
each buyer and seller has to the traders. in this model, traders set
prices strategically, and then buyers and sellers react to the prices
they are offered. we show that the resulting game always has a
subgame perfect nash equilibrium, and that all equilibria lead to
an efficient (i.e. socially optimal) allocation of goods. we extend
these results to a more general type of matching market, such as one
finds in the matching of job applicants and employers. finally, we
consider how the profits obtained by the traders depend on the 
underlying graph - roughly, a trader can command a positive profit if
and only if it has an essential connection in the network structure,
thus providing a graph-theoretic basis for quantifying the amount
of competition among traders.
our work differs from recent studies of how price is affected
by network structure through our modeling of price-setting as a
strategic activity carried out by a subset of agents in the system,
rather than studying prices set via competitive equilibrium or by a
truthful mechanism.
