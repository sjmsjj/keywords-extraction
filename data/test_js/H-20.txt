new event detection (ned) aims at detecting from one or
multiple streams of news stories that which one is reported on a
new event (i.e. not reported previously). with the overwhelming
volume of news available today, there is an increasing need for a
ned system which is able to detect new events more efficiently
and accurately. in this paper we propose a new ned model to
speed up the ned task by using news indexing-tree dynamically.
moreover, based on the observation that terms of different types
have different effects for ned task, two term reweighting
approaches are proposed to improve ned accuracy. in the first
approach, we propose to adjust term weights dynamically based
on previous story clusters and in the second approach, we propose
to employ statistics on training data to learn the named entity
reweighting model for each class of stories. experimental results
on two linguistic data consortium (ldc) datasets tdt2 and
tdt3 show that the proposed model can improve both efficiency
and accuracy of ned task significantly, compared to the baseline
system and other existing systems.
