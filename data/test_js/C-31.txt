many organizations are required to author documents for various
purposes, and such documents may need to be accessible by all
member of the organization. this access may be needed for
editing or simply viewing a document. in some cases these
documents are shared between authors, via email, to be edited.
this can easily cause incorrect version to be sent or conflicts
created between multiple users trying to make amendments to a
document. there may even be multiple different documents in the
process of being edited. the user may be required to search for a
particular document, which some search tools such as google
desktop may be a solution for local documents but will not find a
document on another user"s machine. another problem arises
when a document is made available on a user"s machine and that
user is offline, in which case the document is no longer
accessible. in this paper we present apocrita, a revolutionary
distributed p2p file sharing system for intranets.
