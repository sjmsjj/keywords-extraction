this paper proposes, implements, and evaluates in terms of worst
case performance, an online metrics collection strategy to
facilitate application adaptation via object mobility using a mobile
object framework and supporting middleware. the solution is
based upon an abstract representation of the mobile object system,
which holds containers aggregating metrics for each specific
component including host managers, runtimes and mobile objects.
a key feature of the solution is the specification of multiple
configurable criteria to control the measurement and propagation
of metrics through the system. the mobjex platform was used as
the basis for implementation and testing with a number of
laboratory tests conducted to measure scalability, efficiency and
the application of simple measurement and propagation criteria to
reduce collection overhead.
