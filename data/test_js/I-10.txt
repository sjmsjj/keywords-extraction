this article deals with the problem of collaborative 
learning in a multi-agent system. here each agent can update
incrementally its beliefs b (the concept representation) so
that it is in a way kept consistent with the whole set of
information k (the examples) that he has received from
the environment or other agents. we extend this notion
of consistency (or soundness) to the whole mas and 
discuss how to obtain that, at any moment, a same consistent
concept representation is present in each agent. the 
corresponding protocol is applied to supervised concept learning.
the resulting method smile (standing for sound 
multiagent incremental learning) is described and experimented
here. surprisingly some difficult boolean formulas are 
better learned, given the same learning set, by a multi agent
system than by a single agent.
