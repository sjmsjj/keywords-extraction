in multiagent systems, strategic settings are often analyzed
under the assumption that the players choose their strategies
simultaneously. however, this model is not always realistic.
in many settings, one player is able to commit to a 
strategy before the other player makes a decision. such models
are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or
stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often
significantly different from optimal play in the model where
strategies are selected simultaneously.
the recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic
solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the 
exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the 
designer is implicitly in a leadership position). in this 
paper, we study how to compute optimal strategies to commit
to under both commitment to pure strategies and 
commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and bayesian
games. we give both positive results (efficient algorithms)
and negative results (np-hardness results).
