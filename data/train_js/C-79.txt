this paper describes a cross-layer approach to designing robust
p2p system over mobile ad-hoc networks. the design is based on
simple functional primitives that allow routing at both p2p and
network layers to be integrated to reduce overhead. with these
primitives, the paper addresses various load balancing techniques.
preliminary simulation results are also presented.
