this paper analyzes bilateral multi-issue negotiation between 
selfinterested autonomous agents. the agents have time constraints in
the form of both deadlines and discount factors. there are m > 1
issues for negotiation where each issue is viewed as a pie of size
one. the issues are indivisible (i.e., individual issues cannot be
split between the parties; each issue must be allocated in its 
entirety to either agent). here different agents value different issues
differently. thus, the problem is for the agents to decide how to
allocate the issues between themselves so as to maximize their 
individual utilities. for such negotiations, we first obtain the 
equilibrium strategies for the case where the issues for negotiation are
known a priori to the parties. then, we analyse their time 
complexity and show that finding the equilibrium offers is an np-hard
problem, even in a complete information setting. in order to 
overcome this computational complexity, we then present negotiation
strategies that are approximately optimal but computationally 
efficient, and show that they form an equilibrium. we also analyze the
relative error (i.e., the difference between the true optimum and the
approximate). the time complexity of the approximate equilibrium
strategies is o(nm/ 2
) where n is the negotiation deadline and
the relative error. finally, we extend the analysis to online 
negotiation where different issues become available at different time points
and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues.
specifically, we show that an approximate equilibrium exists for
online negotiation and show that the expected difference between
the optimum and the approximate is o(
âˆš
m) . these approximate
strategies also have polynomial time complexity.
