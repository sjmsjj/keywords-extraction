enterprises in the public and private sectors have been 
making their large spatial data archives available over the 
internet. however, interactive work with such large volumes
of online spatial data is a challenging task. we propose
two efficient approaches to remote access to large spatial
data. first, we introduce a client-server architecture where
the work is distributed between the server and the 
individual clients for spatial query evaluation, data visualization,
and data management. we enable the minimization of the
requirements for system resources on the client side while
maximizing system responsiveness as well as the number of
connections one server can handle concurrently. second, for
prolonged periods of access to large online data, we 
introduce appoint (an approach for peer-to-peer oï¬„oading
the internet). this is a centralized peer-to-peer approach
that helps internet users transfer large volumes of online
data efficiently. in appoint, active clients of the 
clientserver architecture act on the server"s behalf and 
communicate with each other to decrease network latency, improve
service bandwidth, and resolve server congestions.
