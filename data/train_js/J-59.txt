a set of jobs need to be served by a single server which can
serve only one job at a time. jobs have processing times
and incur waiting costs (linear in their waiting time). the
jobs share their costs through compensation using monetary
transfers. we characterize the shapley value rule for this
model using fairness axioms. our axioms include a bound
on the cost share of jobs in a group, efficiency, and some
independence properties on the the cost share of a job.
